# Contributing to Power Project open-source software repository

Thanks for checking out the Power Project open-source software repository! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others who read and use these software.

## Types of contributions we're looking for

There are many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in descending order of need):

-   Fix inconsistencies or inaccuracies
-   Add connectivity to external sources of information, such as web maps, monitoring sensors, etc.
-   Translation to other languages

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives.
-   If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://bugzilla.baseform.com/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/power-baseform/DSP-MOB/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

-   **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
-   **If your contribution is major,** such as a new module, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
